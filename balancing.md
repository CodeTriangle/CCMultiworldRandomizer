This document contains the various current balancing proposals

## Zelda Mode

Proposed by Juanba: https://discord.com/channels/1145762453658026104/1145762454106800149/1198713702552178808

Remove RPG elements entirely, letting the player focus on the more Zelda-like aspects of the game: dungeon crawling and exploration.

* Experience and equipment are disabled.
* Enemies are level 1.

### Pros

* Deals cleanly with the equipment question so we don't have to think about it.

### Cons

* No arts, which will lead to boring combat.
* Making combat more interesting will lead to a run with almost no challenge.
* Limited customization of playstyle.

## Zelda Mode+

Proposed by me, right now.

Remove most RPG elements, but add them back in a limited way so that there is some progression.

* Experience is disabled.
* Lea is ~level 10.
* Enemies range from ~level 10 to ~level 20.
* A few levels of progressive gear are available, which raise your level to ~level 20.

### Pros

* Mimics a Zelda randomizer more closely.
* Enemies are initially hard to beat but get easier as you receive more progressive equipment.
* You can still face the final boss with limited gear, but it will be easier with better gear.

### Cons

* Limited arts, limited customization of playstyle.
* Might be *extremely* difficult to balance.

## Global Boost Mode

Proposed by CodeTriangle: https://discord.com/channels/1145762453658026104/1157002643177230368/1196284030698668142

Allow the player to boost at their leisure, but keep the challenge with the bosses.

* Initially decrease all enemy levels to a universally low band of values, i.e. ~level 4 to ~level 15
* Shuffle boosters into the pool, each of which boosts the level of every enemy by ~10 levels.
* Bosses retain their vanilla levels (with an optional multiplier perhaps) and do not boost like most enemies.
* Bosses are not in logic until Lea has enough boosters to surpass their level.

### Pros

* Even and fair gradient for leveling up.
* Maintains challenge by requiring the player to beat a level 60 creator (but allows them to level past it for an easier fight anyway).
* Ensures the player can make the game as easy or as hard as they want at any moment.

### Cons

* May require large amounts of back-and-forth to find the enemies that are actually at your level once a booster is engaged.
* May lead to a serious grind.
* The interface to activate this would be annoying to access.

## Get Down to My Level

Proposed by CodeTriangle: https://discord.com/channels/1145762453658026104/1157002643177230368/1171185795231662151

* Everything is vanilla except enemies are only normalized down, not up.

### Pros

* Allows the player to grind to the max level in the area that they will need.

### Cons

* Encourages players to just grind levels wherever they are even if that means grinding from level 10 to level 40 in So'najiz.

## Level Zones

Proposed by GodlFire: https://discord.com/channels/1145762453658026104/1157002643177230368/1196867964532707368

* Experience is turned off.
* Each area is assigned a band of levels, in a logical manner.
* Progressive levels are items.
* Areas are not in logic until the player has enough levels to reach it.

### Pros

* There will be a logical path that has enemies at your level so its not just a curb stomp or getting stomped.
* You retain the idea of getting stronger as you progress through the seed as older zones are now much lower level. (editado)

### Cons

* Requires progressive levels in order to work as intended.
